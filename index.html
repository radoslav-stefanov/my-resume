<p><span class="areatitle">About Me:</span></p>
<p class="indented">Originally from Bulgrian coastal city Varna and residing in the capital Sofia since 2005, I'm a proud geek and love what I do for work. I've had many job titles over the years; I started as a NOC support engineer, being working for a while now as a system administrator. Recently I found my strongest passion in tooling/automation development and developer productivity. In the current market I'd probably describe myself as a "DevOps Engineer" (a title I loathe) or a full-stack developer. I'm currently immersed in all things AWS, VMW, reliability, security, continuous integration/delivery, and developer enablement; right now, this is mainly focused on providing shared services and common tooling, patterns and documentation for a large and growing VMW container based infrastructure. In the past my major focuses have included large-scale ansible configuration management deployments and redesigns, monitoring (metrics, logs, and some big Nagios/Zabbix installs), web application development, wireless network architecture and deployment, and datacenter operations.</p>
<p class="indented">I'm currently employed by Hostopia Bulgaria, part of Deluxe Corporation as a System Engineer on their Release WebForce development team. A wonderful group of brilliant, passionate, innovative engineers. The majority of my - and the team's - work is focused on developer productivity and enabling fast, secure, reliable Docker application deployment. I've been involved in a wide variety of projects from assisting teams with application deployment and monitoring to architecting our Ansible/Docker implementation and integrating it with applications and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="indented">I'm passionate about doing things right, especially when that comes to the non-functional requirements that all too often get ignored, such as monitoring (ubiquitous observability), reliability (resilience and designing for failure) and security. I've never really understood the gap between ops and dev, and consider myself to mostly be a developer who automates what were traditionally ops tasks. I'm a Free Software fan and advocate, though in my work all I ask is for an honest and unbiased comparison of all options, and to consider giving back to the community. I'm a complete data geek and collect metrics on everything I can, whether it's the apps I'm running in production or the health of my car's engine. I also consider attention to details to be at extreme importance and I really dislike having to deal with people with messy workflow.
</p>
<p class="indented">Outside of work and my personal software projects, my main passions are mountain biking, hiking, camping, and spending time with my family. I also love traveling though I haven't done much lately (one of my long-time dreams is to spend a few years traveling the EU and Russia in an RV) and occasionally try to reignite my passion for motorbikes.</p>
<p><span class="areatitle">What I&#39;m looking for:</span></p>
<p class="indented">I'm currently employed full-time on a team that I love, though I'm always open to discussing new possibilities. I'm currently based in Sofia, and work from home one or days a week; I am not looking to relocate and am not looking for any five-day-a-week in the office positions (and have a strong preference towards full-time remote work). Ideally, I'd like my next position to be a seniord role in an environment with a strong DevOps culture (including management support), that values automation, reliability, empowering developers, and sharing their experience, best practices, and code both internally and publicly. I like companies that already <em>want</em> to build modern, cloud-native, fault-tolerant, observable services, and seek developers to push those goals to more efficient, reliable, scalable, and user-friendly levels.</p>
